This file contains information about the performance data that has been generated.

- outputs/big_array
Each processor has an array of size 100000 and completes 10000 iterations.
Each directory represents a different message size, with each file representing a different number of processors.
Timings data from Morar.

- outputs/small_array
Same as big_array but withan array size of 100 and 1000000 iterations

- outputs/archer/weak_scaling
Contains weak scaling data with a local array size of 100 and 1000000 iterations.
Data from both powers of 2 and multiples of 24.
Timing data from Archer

- outputs/archer/strong
Strong scaling data with a global array size of 1638400 and 10000 iterations.
Timing data from Archer

- outputs/archer/1pernode
Weak scaling with only one core used per node
